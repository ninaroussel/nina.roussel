- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ttalgi7678, aka Nina. 
- ğŸ‘€ I want math to engross me but it can only happen with me... My lack of involvement is embarrassing. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a first-year student in a prep school for the national French management schools exam. 
- ğŸ‘½ I want to speak Korean (and Spanish for my exam) and learn how to code (Python is the only language I have to learn for my exam... )
- ğŸ’œ I would be very enthusiastic if you had a 2-month-internship next summer in South Korea for me. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in my first out of two years intensive prep school for French management schools exam. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me : rnina7678@gmail.com
